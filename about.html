    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Niky</span>, a digital artist and creative technologist crafting visuals that live in between worlds: between art and code, signal and noise, audience and performer. My work blends generative systems, real-time visuals, and hands-on interactivity, ranging from projection-mapped installations and immersive experiences to tactile workshops and brand activations.</p>

<p>Over the past 15+ years, Iâ€™ve designed interactive media for concerts, classrooms, festivals, and showcases. I create visuals that respond to sound, space, and human presence. Iâ€™m especially drawn to glitch aesthetics, accessible tools, and building joyful, experimental entry points into creative technology.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also worked extensively in the field as a brand auditor, tech support specialist, and educator. All of these roles have shaped how I approach systems, storytelling, and audience engagement. Whether Iâ€™m debugging a coding sketch, leading a DIY workshop, or building visuals for a giant dome, my favorite projects are the ones that spark connection and feel alive at scale.</p>
