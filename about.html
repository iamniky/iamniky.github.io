    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Niky</span>, a digital artist and creative technologist based in the Midwest. My work blends code, visuals, and playâ€”ranging from generative art and projection mapping to brand activations and tactile workshops.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve spent the last decade designing interactive media for public spaces, community events, and education initiatives. Iâ€™m especially passionate about accessible tools, glitch aesthetics, and building joyful entry points into creative tech.</p>

    <p>Outside of coding and visuals, Iâ€™ve done extensive work as a brand ambassador and field specialist, engaging with real-world audiences through events, demos, and immersive installations.</p>

    <p>Whether Iâ€™m animating a vector creature, debugging a Hydra synth sketch, or running a DIY workshop with curious kidsâ€”my favorite projects are the ones that spark connection.</p>
  <p>
ðŸ‘‰ Curious what that looks like? <a href="/thegreatportfolio.html" class="highlight">Check out my portfolio here.</a>
